# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test

A simple terminal-based typing speed test game built using Python. This application challenges users to type a randomly chosen sentence and calculates both their **typing speed** (in words per second) and **accuracy** (by counting mistakes).

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Randomly selects a sentence for testing
- ⏱️ Measures typing speed based on time taken
- ❌ Counts character-level mistakes
- 🧠 Easy to use, fully in the terminal

---

## 🛠 Requirements

No external libraries needed! Only uses built-in Python modules:

- `random`
- `time`

✅ Works with Python 3.x

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. The program asks if you're ready to start the test.
2. If you type `yes`, a sentence will appear.
3. You must type the sentence **exactly** as shown.
4. The app will calculate:
   - Your typing **speed** in words per second.
   - Your **mistake count** (character-level).
